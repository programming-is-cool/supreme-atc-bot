# Supreme Add to Cart Bot

This bot was created to automate purchases on supremenewyork.com.


# For research only

Due to Supreme's implementation of anti-bot software (mainly pooky.js), this bot can no longer check out successfully.
Items will still be added to the cart and checkout info filled out, but checking out will fail.
This is due to missing cookie values that are generated by the pooky.js file.  The pooky.js file tracks mouse movements, 
browser automation tags and so on.  Reverse engineering the file, obtaining the AES key and generating the necessary 
cookies is not worth the time in my view.

Due to the lack of interest in continuing development on this bot, there will no longer be any updates.

## Requirements

This bot uses the gecko driver from Mozilla.
